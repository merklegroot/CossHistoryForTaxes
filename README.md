# Coss 2018 History Script

## Abstract
Coss's website will let you download trade and transaction history.  
However, this forces you to download multiple CSVs and combine them.  
Additionally, it doesn't currently include the witdrawal fees.  
  
The API doesn't give you the trade fees and doesn't provide a mechanism at all for getting transactions.  
  
It's tax time and that data is needed now.  
That's where this script comes in.  
  
## Disclaimer
There are no guarantees about the accuracy of the resulting data.

## Instructions
Log in to Coss on Chrome (probably works on other browsers too, but I haven't tested it.)  
Open the Chrome Dev Tools by hitting F12.  
Select the Console tab.  
Copy the script and paste the entire thing in.  
Wait a bit (it took about 15 seconds for me).  
  
A CSV file should automatically download.  
If it doesn't, check your pop-up blocker settings.
